\usage{
contrast.BBSSModel(
  obj,
  contrast,
  generate_credible_bands = FALSE,
  credible_band_width = 0.95,
  component = NULL,
  location = NULL,
  silent = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A fitted object of class \code{"BBSSModel"}.}

\item{contrast}{A numeric matrix specifying the linear
contrast(s) over the intercept and fixed-effect coefficients. The required length
(number of columns) is \eqn{1 + P}, where \eqn{P} is the number of fixed-effect
terms stored in \code{obj$settings$P}. The first entry corresponds to the
\emph{intercept} (population mean spatial map), and positions 2 through
\eqn{P+1} correspond to the fixed-effect coefficients in the same order used at fit time.
If a vector is supplied, it is treated as a single-row matrix. This argument
can be directly obtained using \link{generate_model_matrix.BBSSModel}.}

\item{generate_credible_bands}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, report lower/upper credible
limits for each estimate.}

\item{credible_band_width}{Width of the credible band as a probability in \eqn{(0,1)};
default \code{0.95} yields 95 percent credible bands.}

\item{component}{Optional integer vector of component indices to evaluate. Defaults
to \code{1:obj$settings$Q}.}

\item{location}{Optional integer vector of voxel/vertex indices to evaluate. Defaults
to \code{1:obj$settings$V}.}

\item{silent}{Logical; if \code{FALSE}, print progress messages.}

\item{contrast_labels}{Optional character vector of labels (length equal to number of
contrasts) to include in the output.}

\item{calculate_savage_dickey}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, compute the conditional
Savage–Dickey Ratio for each contrast/location/component.}

\item{calculate_imp_reweights_savage_dickey}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, compute an
importance-sampling–calibrated Savage–Dickey estimate and its effective sample size
(ESS). Enabling this implicitly sets \code{calculate_savage_dickey = TRUE}.}

\item{n_importance_resample}{Positive integer; number of importance resamples used
when \code{calculate_imp_reweights_savage_dickey = TRUE}.}

\description{
Linear contrasts of covariate effects for a \code{BBSSModel}
}
\details{
Computes linear contrasts of the fixed-effect terms in a fitted \code{BBSSModel}
and returns location- and component-specific estimates (optionally with credible bands and
Savage–Dickey ratios). Supports one or many contrasts at once. NOTE - 
at this time the Bayes factor construction is under development. Please only 
make use of the credible bands. Also note that these credible bands are based
on the variational approximation and thus likely underestimate the actual
uncertainty.
